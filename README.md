# KeyLogger Project

A Python-based keylogger project that captures keystrokes, system information, clipboard data, audio recordings, and screenshots. The project can also send collected data to a specified email address. Encrypted data files are stored locally and can be decrypted with a generated key.

- **Keystroke Logging**: Records all keystrokes and saves them to a file.
- **System Information Logging**: Captures information about the operating system, IP address, and machine details.
- **Clipboard Data Logging**: Copies the clipboard contents and stores them locally.
- **Audio Recording**: Records audio from the microphone for a specified duration.
- **Screenshot Capture**: Takes screenshots of the screen.
- **Email Sending**: Sends collected logs to a specified email address.
- **Encryption**: Encrypts the collected data files using a unique key for security.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts encrypted files for reviewing the collected information.

##  Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Required libraries:
  - `cryptography`
  - `pynput`
  - `scipy`
  - `pillow`
  - `sounddevice`
  - `requests`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration: Email Setup

Before using the email sending feature, configure your email credentials in the script:
